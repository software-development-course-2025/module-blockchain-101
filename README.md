# Welcome to the Blockchain-101 Repository

This repository serves as a **showcase** of my foundational skills in **Blockchain Technology**. It's a comprehensive portfolio of the assignments and projects from the **Blockchain-101** module. My work here demonstrates a solid grasp of key concepts, including decentralized ledgers, cryptographic hashing, and smart contracts.

I invite evaluators, examiners, and recruiters to explore the code and see my hands-on experience with this transformative technology. This repository is not just a collection of files; it's proof of my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world blockchain scenarios.
